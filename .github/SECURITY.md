# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the latest release on `main`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Do not open public issues for vulnerabilities.

Preferred channel:

- GitHub private vulnerability reporting (Repository `Security` tab)

Fallback channel:

- open a minimal public issue titled `Security contact request` without technical details
- we will provide a private contact path for full disclosure

Include:

- affected version/tag and OS
- reproduction steps or proof of concept
- impact assessment
- suggested mitigation (if available)

We will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible and coordinate a fix/release timeline.
